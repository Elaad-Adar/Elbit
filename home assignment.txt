 

The task will require the following items 

a Jenkins groovy file that creates jobs ( look for job DSL plugin ). 

Items : 

 

1.       Jenkins groovy file creates a pipeline job that pulls code from your GitHub repo.

       Build a docker container and push it to the docker hub. 

      The docker it builds is a python ( flask simple web application that talks to the local docker engine and gets the list of running containers ) 

2.       Another job that takes a default Nginx docker file and modifies it and pushes a proxy pass to the first container (and injects

               in the request headers a source IP ) then push the container to docker hub  

3.       A third job that runs the two containers and exposes the Nginx container ports only on the local Jenkins machine then sends

       a request to verify the  request has gone ok  and finishes successfully

In the end, push everything to your GitHub project and send me the link.

Please let me know if you have any questions
